Steps To Detection:-
--------------------
1-Read Image RGB
2-Convert to YUV
3-Split color Channel and take v (to spceify Redness)
4-apply Binary Threshold on image(Take threshold=150)
5-apply Morphology by kernel size(3,3)
6-find Contours
7-select the Sign Contour(i will generalize it and take the biggest contours but now i select it manually)
8-get coordinates x,y,w,h of boundray Box which include the Sign Contour
9-crop the sign from image by boundray Box Coordinate
10-apply CNN on sign image , Classifier predict it 0 (Refer to Stop Sign)
